# setup-homeassistant

_Setup a Home Assistant instance in your GitHub action flow._

This can be usefull for any number of reasons, but espesially for testing where you need to test against a running installation of Home Assistant.

During the run it will validate the configuration, and create a LLAT that can be used for authentication.

## Usage

```yaml
- name: ðŸ‘· Setup Home Assistant
  id: homeassistant
  uses: ludeeus/setup-homeassistant@main
```

When this step is complete you will have access to these variables you can use later in your job.

variable | description
-- | --
`${{ steps.homeassistant.outputs.url }}` | This is the URL to reach the instance.
`${{ steps.homeassistant.outputs.token }}` | This is a LLAT you can use for autenticated requests.
`${{ steps.homeassistant.outputs.containername }}` | This is the name of the container that is running, can be usefull if you need to query the logs.

## Inputs

Inputs for actions are defined with the `with:` key for the stage configuration, these inputs are valid:

input | description
-- | --
`tag` | This can be any valid tag for a `homeassistant/home-assistant` container, the default is `dev`.
`config-dir` | Relative path to the configuration directory you want to use, defaults to the root of the repo.
`retry-limit` | How many times/seconds the action will wait for Home Assistant to start before giving up, `360` is the default.
